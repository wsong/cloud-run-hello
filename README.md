# Cloud Run "Hello" container

This repository contains the source code of a sample Go application that is
distributed as the public container image (`gcr.io/cloudrun/hello`) used in the
[Cloud Run quickstart](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/quickstarts/) and as
the suggested container image  in the Cloud Run UI on Cloud Console.

It also contains the source code of a placeholder public container
(`gcr.io/cloudrun/placeholder`)  used to create a placeholder revision when setting up
